# burger

For this assignment I have create a burrger loger. Eat-Da-Burger! A resteraunt app that lets users input the names of burgers the would like to eat. When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be eaten! Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 

The app is created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Hosted from Heroku.
